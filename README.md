### Projects

I have built the following systems and tools to automate workflows, manage leads, and streamline communication:

- WhatsApp Lead Automation – Automatically replies to messages, shares info, and converts interested users into clients without human effort.

- Email Scraping Tool – Automatically collects valid emails from websites, cleans and organizes them, and prepares lists for outreach without manual work.

- Email Automation System – Automatically sends emails, tracks replies, follows up with prospects, and converts leads into clients without manual effort.

- Built and experimented with large language models from scratch.
